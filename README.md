	DnD is a complex and deep game, involving an original world, a complicated storyline, a large web of characters, and a sometimes confusing ruleset. The responsibility to keep track of these elements falls on the Dungeon Master. Taleweaver’s compass is the DM’s best friend because it gives a simple framework for DM’s to store all of the information they need. The software should provide easy and intuitive navigation that allows users to upload their own map, add pins linked to information, and keep general notes about story and characters. This structure provides swift access to relevant information at a moment’s notice. Another benefit of this structure is easy access to sub-maps linked to pins that allow tracking of combat and exploration in a specific area.
 
	Approximately 50 million people play DnD worldwide, yet many are dissatisfied with existing softwares. Apps like DnD Beyond and World Anvil are clunky and hard to use as well as locked behind an expensive paywall. Taleweaver’s Compass will cut through the complexities with a simple and modern user interface that allows DMs to easily track all elements of their game. Our software offers a free alternative for new players that allows them to easily begin playing without having to commit financially. Whether new to DnD, the role of Dungeon Master, or just searching for simple software to use, Taleweaver’s Compass is the software of choice for any Dungeon Master.
