I believe that app/(tabs)/index.tsx sets up the console output to the device that is using the software.

I believe that package.json holds necessary metadata and functions to run the app.

I believe that node_modules/ holds all of the external modules that are used in the program.

I believe that .gitignore causes the program to ignore the files that aren't needed for the project.
